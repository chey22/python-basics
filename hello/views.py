after generating first table via: heroku run python manage.py migrate
Now you can access the https://beginner-python.herokuapp.com/db/ route again,
and youâ€™ll see a simple page update every time you access it:

The code to access the database is straightforward,
and makes use of a simple Django model called Greetings
that you can find in hello/models.py.

Whenever you visit the /db route of your app,
the following method in the hello/views.py file is invoked
which creates a new Greeting and then renders all the existing Greetings:
"""
def db(request):

    greeting = Greeting()
    greeting.save()

    greetings = Greeting.objects.all()

    return render(request, "db.html", {"greetings": greetings})
